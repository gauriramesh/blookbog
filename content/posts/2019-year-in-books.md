2019 was filled with things that changed the way I think about the world. Some of those things were caused through experiences, but a lot of them were ideas I found in books. My goal was to read 23 books in 2019, and as of Christmas, I have read 32 books (28 cover-to-cover and 4 that I read bits and pieces of, or abandoned somewhere in the middle).

In this article, I’ll be covering my top 19 of the year. Reflecting on this list, I found that my favorites weren’t necessarily the ones that confirmed my existing beliefs — they were the ones about people and ideas I knew nothing about previously. I believe this list captures a little bit of who I was, what I wanted to learn, and where my headspace was in 2019. I hope you find something that peaks your interest. Happy New Year!

### 1 — Bad Blood by John Carreyrou
This list is no particular order, but this was my favorite book this year, hands down. A friend of mine loaned this book to me, and she was right about how much I would enjoy reading it. Carreyrou’s gripping journalism and the horrifying story of Theranos push the edges of ethics and science. This book is becoming a movie soon, and you can bet I’ll be there on opening week.

### 2 — Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker
I got this book at a bookstore in India on my vacation last winter because I was so excited to see this chunker of a book had finally come out in paperback! It’s filled to the brim with data and statistics supporting how we’ve come along as a society, and makes me really proud of the world we live in.

### 3 — Brave, Not Perfect by Reshma Saujani
Reshma Saujani is one of my idols, so I was excited to pick up her book when it came out earlier this spring. This book was short and sweet and sends the perfect message. We should be teaching our girls to be brave and not perfect, that the pursuit of perfection is our demise. Brave, not perfect has since become one of my favorite sayings and it’s something I think about when I teach kids to code and when I’m working on my own tough problems.

### 4 — The Moment of Lift by Melinda Gates
Melinda Gates’ book was jaw-dropping. The stories she has to tell about the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, her own personal life, and the stories of the people she’s met all over the world, brought light to issues facing the world that we in first-world countries don’t often see. This should be a must-read for anybody wanting to enter the philanthropy/social good space, especially those who are passionate about lifting women up.

### 5 — Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson
Just Mercy was heartbreaking and hopeful all at the same time. It’s the story of a black lawyer and his work with a black man who was wrongly accused of murder. Prior to reading this book, I’d never dug deep into the justice system and how it affects people of color. At times I wanted to throw this book at the wall and at times I held the pages tightly in hope.

### 6 — You Had me at Hello World by Dona Sarkar
Dona Sarkar is the leader of an advocacy team at Microsoft, so during my internship last summer, I made sure to order a copy of her book. Her book is full of real-world career advice, and career advice that hits really close to home for me as a software engineer. She has amazing tips about everything from negotiating to navigating the workplace. I’ll definitely be reading this book over and over again during the first few years of my career.

### 7 — The Upstarts by Brad Stone
This book was a great deep dive into two famous, different, but not-so-different companies, Airbnb and Uber. Stone does an incredible job setting up the stage for how both of these companies quickly reached “unicorn” status — a unicorn is a privately held company valued at over $1 billion. He analyzes the characters that make up the founders of both companies, some tough business ad workplace challenges they got (or still are going) through, and how both companies made it in the age of the sharing economy.

### 8 — No Hard Feelings by Mollie West Duffy and Liz Fosslien
If you read a book about the workplace this year, I’d recommend this one. This book fills its pages with practical advice, diagrams, pictures, and wit about navigating the workplace as humans with emotions. This is another book I’ll keep coming back to in the coming years.

### 9 — Brotopia: Breaking Up the Boys’ Club of Silicon Valley by Emily Chang
This book was horrifying but eye opening all at the same time about the truths of gender and sex discrimination in Silicon Valley and the “brogrammer” culture that exists. I’ll be the first to tell you how important diversity and inclusion is in our industry, and I’d recommend reading this book to get deep dive into what the problem is so you can learn some ways of solving it in your community.

### 10 — Maybe You Should Talk to Someone: A Therapist, Her Therapist, and Our Lives Revealed by Lori Gottlieb
I read this book in one and a half sittings. It kept me turning the pages and had me laughing and tearing up all at the same time. It also gave me a perspective on therapy that I’ve never seen or read about before — that of a therapist. I think everyone should read this book, but be prepared for emotions from the stories the author shares with her readers.

### 11 — Bubble or Revolution: The Present and Future of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies by Neel Mehta, Adi Agashe, and Parth Detroja
This book was one of the most educational books I had the fortune of reading this year. The authors, product managers at Microsoft, Google, and Facebook, do an amazing job explaining what blockchain and cryptocurrency are to a beginner, with a short history and detailed explanations of the impacts (both positive and negative) this technology can have on the world. I’ve been looking for a digestible and unbiased take on one of the most hyped-up topics in the tech industry. If you are, too, you should read this book.

### 12 — Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life Without Losing Its Soul by Howard Schultz
This was one of my favorite business books of the year. I had the opportunity to hear the current Starbucks CEO, Kevin Johnson, speak at my school this year. Coming into that talk having a background on Starbucks, its business, and the real challenges the executive officers and company faced both from business and cultural perspectives made the talk a lot more influential. While I’m not the biggest fan of Starbucks coffee, I have tremendous respect for the company after learning more about its values and the struggles it has overcome.

### 13 — Ghost in the Wires: My Adventure as the World’s Most Wanted Hacker by Kevin Mitnick
This book is entirely nonfiction but read like a thriller. Kevin Mitnick shares his story of becoming an extremely skilled con artist in the world of telephone hacking. Using his advanced computer/telephone skills and social engineering techniques, he was able to fool some of the smartest people. He spent several years evading law and law enforcement, but he made it out to tell his story. If you have even an ounce of interest in computers, security, or psychology, pick up this book — you won’t regret it.

### 14 — Tools and Weapons: The Promise and Peril of the Digital Age, by Brad Smith
This book, written by the President of Microsoft, does a great job introducing some of the new and exciting technological innovations and how they can be used for both bad and good. This is a great primer on ethics in technology, and begs those in our industry to ask ourselves how we can use technology for good, and warns us about how if we’re not careful, some of these cool new innovations could come at the cost of happiness and, in some cases, people’s lives. I think the intersection of technology, law, and ethics is an important one everyone in this industry should take the time to learn about, so I recommend this book wholeheartedly.

### 15 — The Defining Decade: Why your Twenties Matter and How to Make the Most of Them Now by Meg Jay
This book did a great job of scaring me and making me feel uncomfortable (and also a little too much like an adult!) but it also inspired me to make the most of this decade of my life. I’ll definitely be taking some tips from this book as I graduate from college and start adulting.

### 16 — The War on Normal People by Andrew Yang
This book is written by Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and was the first of many books I hope to read to really understand every candidate’s platform before casting my votes in 2020. Yang’s platform is incredibly unique, as it’s based on Universal Basic Income (UBI), and cites how artificial intelligence will kill thousands of jobs. I found it fascinating hearing his ideas and plans for implementing UBI and his other ideas. It made me think about things I’ve never thought about before.

### 17 — Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance
This book is a memoir of a lawyer who grew up in Middletown, Ohio, the middle of the Rust Belt (a region known for being extremely prolific during the height of the Industrial Revolution, but has been on the decline since). It was crazy reading about his life and how his experiences shaped his views on the world now. This book is a great testament to how your experiences growing up can strongly influence the way you think and perceive the world.

### 18 — Start with Why by Simon Sinek
This is a classic business/management book, and a short and sweet read I got through on a flight to Seattle. Start with Why is about exactly what it sounds — how businesses, people, and people in business should “start with why” before going forward with any decision. Once you figure out your “why”, your company and its people will follow that “why”, which results in happier employees and better results.

### 19 — The Coddling of the American Mind by Greg Lukianoff and Jonathan Haidt
This book is about the prevalence of protectionism on college campuses, and how “three great untruths” are running rampant: what doesn’t kill you makes you weaker, always trust your feelings, and and life is a battle between good and evil people. While I agreed and disagreed with this book in lots of different ways, it ultimately made my top 19 because it challenged me to think about some cultural and societal trends happening with my generation in a wholly new way.

My goal for 2020 is to read 30 books, but reaching this goal is less important to me than finding literature about people, places, and things that stretch my mind and allow me to vicariously widen my worldview.
