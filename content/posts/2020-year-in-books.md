We’re in our final week of 2020, and while just about everything around us has changed, my annual summary of the books I’ve read this year is still in order. Every year, when I write this post, I mention how the books I read are a reflection of my trains of thought during that year. This year, that couldn’t be more true, and as you’ll see from the 40+ books I’ll share with you today, 2020 had me asking questions, learning, riding emotional rollercoasters, getting lost in stories, and trying to find my way in the world.

My reading habits changed. I started using Goodreads to track books and I participated in my very first book clubs (a popular pandemic trend). One of the major things you’ll notice from my list is the greater diversity of books. Previously, I pretty much only used to read nonfiction books that I thought would help me in my life or career, typically along the lines of psychology, business, and self-help. That’s still my favorite genre, but this year I started viewing reading (as well my hobbies in general) as more than just a productive pastime, but something I could also do just for fun and entertainment – not everything has to have “work” value. The additional time and change in perspective led to a lot more fiction books, more diverse nonfiction books, and books in different languages and mediums – and I’m glad for it. You’ll also notice that some of the books on my list are painfully relevant to today’s most pressing topics, in times where I was (and still am) looking towards history and the brave retellings of experiences to understand where we are as a society and what needs to be done to move forward. What really happened during the 1918 influenza pandemic? What is the story of the United States of America? Would people of different colors and socioeconomic classes tell the the same story?

I’ve played around with different ways of sharing my reading list – sometimes I only share a subset, and sometimes I share all of them. This year, I want to share all 43 books I read with you, and maybe categorize it a bit – it gives the best picture of my year in books, and hopefully there’s a better chance you’ll find something you like.

## Top Nonfiction
### The Making of Asian America: A History
The Making of Asian America: A History taught me so much about the history of Asian people in the United States, without forgetting that the phrase “Asian-American” has a litany of different meanings. I knew a lot about very recent Asian-American history, having experienced some of it myself. But this book takes you way back to the earliest days of Asian migration to the Americas and brings you all the way to the present, telling a story that I definitely did not learn in history class. It tells a story of race, immigration, hard work and hope, and it makes me proud to be an Asian-American.

### Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams
Why We Sleep was one of the most fascinating books I’ve ever read, and probably my most commonly recommended one of this year. After having experienced the negative effects poor sleep habits can have on mental and physical health, I’ve always been a strong advocate of getting enough sleep. This book gave me the statistics to back up that belief and taught me some new things about sleep I never knew before. I highly recommend this if you have any interest in sleep medicine or psychology, and especially if you’re looking to go into 2021 with better sleep habits.

### Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents
This year was a year of listening, learning, and speaking up for change against the injustices faced by the Black community. This book was one of the most interesting works I have read, as it studied not just race but the human concept of “caste” more generally, deep diving into the concept of human ranking across the Indian caste system, race in the United States, and Nazism. It drew parallels I’d never have drawn on my own. It was beautifully written, and also one of the most painful books I’ve ever read. I couldn’t recommend it more highly.

## Top Fiction
### The Rosie Project
I read the Rosie Project for our girls’ friend group book club, and it had me laughing the entire time. What a heartfelt and genuine book. I’d highly recommend this book for any book club, or if you just want something happy to read.

### Americanah
I borrowed this book from a dear friend more than two years ago and finally got around to reading it early on in the pandemic. This book explores complex personal relationships and also touches on the deeply human challenges created by race and immigration.

## Most Unique
### Yo No Soy Tu Perfecta Hija Mexicana
For the first time this year, I read an entire novel in a non-English language. It’s a novel for middle schoolers, so I’m not sure my readers here would necessarily love it, but I wanted to pick a book at a level that would be an appropriate challenge for me without being too easy or too hard. It’s been almost five years since I last studied Spanish, but after reading a sign entirely in Spanish and realizing I remembered more than I thought, I wanted to challenge myself by reading a book in Spanish and then reading the same book in English to see what I missed. To my surprise, I was able to pick up the entire story from cover to cover. The main things I missed out on from not being a fluent Spanish reader were idiomatic phrases and little personality quirks. It was difficult, but well worth the exercise.

### Solutions and Other Problems
Solutions and Other Problems is a graphic novel by Allie Brosh exploring the extremely harsh realities of life in comics that will have you cackling and also holding back tears. I’d never really read a book like this before, but I really enjoyed it.

## Best for Developers
### Web Application Security
This book was a really approachable introduction to application security for web developers, going through how to think like a hacker, evaluating attack surfaces, and going through common exploits and how to avoid them as a web developer. I really liked that this was a soft but extremely informative introduction to security in a way that’s closer to what I do in my day-to-day work. If you’re a developer, regardless of if you have an interest in security, I think this book will be helpful for you.

### Become an Awesome Software Architect
I’m really interested in broad patterns in software architecture and this book did a great job of going through some modern software architecture do’s and don’ts. While I haven’t used any particular pattern from this book yet, the book got me thinking in terms of a software architect, which has helped me better approach my problem-solving. I also wrote a different blog post about an analogy from this book here.

### The Language Instinct
This book gets bonus points if you’re also interested in language! It goes into depth about how our brains create language, how language is constructed (which draws parallels to how programming languages are constructed as well). Be warned, it’s a pretty academic read, but worth it if you have interest in language in the all-encompassing sense of the word.
