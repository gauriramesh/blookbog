Whether you reached here via a typo in your browser, a staged phishing email at work, or are here intentionally - welcome! I'm Gauri and I created **blook's bog** as a way to approach blogging differently than I have in the past. I've contributed to, built, and torn down many blogs over the years - book blogs, tech blogs, writing for others' book or tech blogs, you name it -  and often abandon these projects once it starts to feel forced and cookie-cutter. I'm hoping spending time with blook will help me keep the fun in writing, since that's the whole reason I do this. 

some content you shouldn't be surprised to find on **blook's bog**  - book reviews, of course, especially on asian-american and south-asian-american fiction, but anything goes. maybe the occasional philosophical musing about work or life. but again, anything goes - it's **blook's bog** and we're all just living in it.

p.s. - blook might look a little spooky in dark theme, but I promise, he's really nice.
