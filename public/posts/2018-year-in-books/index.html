    <h1>Year in Books 2018</h1>
    <h2 id="why-so-many-books">Why So Many Books?</h2>
<p>Some of you might wonder why I chose to spend a lot of my free time in 2018 doing this instead of any of the other things with which I occupy my free time. The answer is simple: I love reading. It allows me to lose myself in another person’s world, learn from others’ experiences, and reflect constantly. It gives my mind a new dimension to explore. At the root, it gives me peace, and what I learn is often helpful in my day-to-day life.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this list of books I read, I find that together they create a picture, a story that resembles the things I was thinking about, what I wanted to learn more about, or something I wanted to implement in my life. I find that this list resembles some sort of snapshot of who I was this year. I hope you find this helpful to you!</p>
<h2 id="the-list">THE LIST</h2>
<h3 id="1-thrive-by-arianna-huffington">1. Thrive by Arianna Huffington</h3>
<p>Little did I know that this book would be different than every other business book I’ve read. Instead of being about exploiting every little hack to improve your productivity, this one was about making well-being and giving a priority, shone some new light on meditation, and creating a more whole you that isn’t just work. This was something I really needed in my life when I read it, and helped me prioritize my mental health and the power of community service. Thrive has since become of my all-time favorite books.</p>
<h3 id="2-sapiens-by-yuval-noah-harari">2. Sapiens by Yuval Noah Harari</h3>
<p>When I was spending the summer in Seattle, I visited Amazon books and this was front and center at the store. I’ve always been interested in anthropology and I’ve wanted to learn more about the human condition. I got a library card and went with my aunt and uncle to pick this one up from the Bellevue Library. It was absolutely stunning. Would recommend.</p>
<h3 id="3-hit-refresh-by-satya-nadella">3. Hit Refresh by Satya Nadella</h3>
<p>This one’s a little more business-ey than Thrive, but I found a few tokens of home in it, especially when Satya shared his Indian upbringing and the values that were instilled in him. Reading this book made me really excited to pursue another internship at Microsoft, because I learned how well the company’s values align with my own. I have fond memories of reading this book a few stories above the waterfront at Storyville Coffee in Pike’s Place, Seattle, WA.</p>
<h3 id="4-year-of-yes-by-shonda-rhimes">4. Year of Yes by Shonda Rhimes</h3>
<p>I saw a little reflection of myself in the title, about always saying no to things that might sound fun or might be a tiny little risk. This book is about Shonda Rhimes learning to say yes sometimes. While I didn’t really relate to a lot of her life experiences or her career, opening up more was something I did learn and think about from time to time.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-one-world-schoolhouse-by-salman-khan">5. The One World Schoolhouse by Salman Khan</h3>
<p>I found this book at Ada’s Technical Books in Capitol Hill, Seattle, WA. I knew I had to get it right when I saw the title and the author. Sal Khan is the founder and CEO of Khan Academy, and this book shares his vision for education. This book was incredible, thought outside the box, and really got me thinking about the state of the United States education system and what role technology has to play in it. Sal talked about his startup story and all of the different ideas he toyed with when thinking about how he could dramatically change the face of education. I hope to be someone who changes the face of education someday, too.</p>
<h3 id="6-originals-by-adam-grant">6. Originals by Adam Grant</h3>
<p>I read this because I’m a non-conformist. Adam Grant is a fantastic author and I have loved every single book he reviews, so why not give his titles a shot?</p>
<h3 id="7-give-and-take-by-adam-grant">7. Give and Take by Adam Grant</h3>
<p>I found this book in the business section of Amazon books in the Bellevue Square Mall when my family was having a somewhat impromptu family reunion in Seattle when they dropped me off to start my internship last summer. I was interesting in reading people’s stories about giving since I feel like I’m a little different from a lot of my classmates in that I spend a lot of my free time (when I’m not reading) “giving” — volunteering or doing nonprofit work. Thrive actually references this book in a section where it talks about the importance of community service, so it seemed fitting.</p>
<h3 id="8-13-things-mentally-strong-people-dont-do-by-amy-morin">8. 13 Things Mentally Strong People Don’t Do by Amy Morin</h3>
<p>Why I chose this book: I ran across this book in a Barnes and Noble. I was in the midst of recovering from a really stressful semester where I developed a lot of bad mental habits. By this time I had identified adaptability as a weakness. I picked this one up, figuring it might be helpful. It also had a pretty interesting title. I found myself mentally exercising a lot while reading this book. A lot of the habits were things that I had (surprise!) I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a lesson in resilience.</p>
<h3 id="9-small-great-things-by-jodi-picoult">9. Small Great Things by Jodi Picoult</h3>
<p>Once I started, it took me less than 48 hours to finish. The book was so beautifully written, as is Jodi Picoult’s style. This book really, really addresses race issues, and makes you think about them in a way that you don’t typically think about them. Honestly, I was surprised it was even fiction. I would read it again and again and again. I’m giving a copy of this book to my roommate for Christmas.</p>
<h3 id="10-the-fuzzy-and-the-techie-by-scott-hartley">10. The Fuzzy and the Techie by Scott Hartley</h3>
<p>Fuzzy and the Techie is about the role that artists and the humanities play in technology, and goes to prove that the two disciplines aren’t so different at all. I really appreciated this one, especially since as I was growing up, I was much more of an artist/writer than I was a mathematician/scientist, and today find myself pursuing a STEM career I love. I would recommend this eye-opening book to everyone, especially those who think STEM has no place in the humanities.</p>
<h3 id="11-educated-by-tara-westover">11. Educated by Tara Westover</h3>
<p>I am super passionate about education and I had heard so many things about this book. It was face out in every bookstore that I went to. I ended up buying it at Half-Price Books in Bellevue, WA. It was incredible, and reaffirmed to me how powerful education really is.</p>
<h3 id="12-crazy-rich-asians-by-kevin-kwan">12. Crazy Rich Asians by Kevin Kwan</h3>
<p>One of the only fiction books I read this year. I wanted to read the book before watching the movie, and it was really good. I related to a lot of the characters and it’s making me want to visit Singapore.</p>
<h3 id="13-the-power-of-habit-by-charles-duhigg">13. The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg</h3>
<p>This one wins “most referenced book” of the year. I found myself referencing this in classes and in conversations. This book was one of the only books I found it easy to actually implement in my day-t0-day life, and led to habits like bullet journaling and working out more often.</p>
<h3 id="14-shoe-dog-by-phil-knight">14. Shoe Dog by Phil Knight</h3>
<p>Phil Knight, the founder of Nike, is a REALLY cool guy. I never knew anything about him until I read this book, and it gave some amazing insight into what running a business is actually like, and gave a lot of insight into how Phil Knight thinks. It proves that anyone with a passion really can make it big.</p>
<h3 id="15-contagious-by-jonah-berger">15. Contagious by Jonah Berger</h3>
<p>I read this book for a class. I was studying how movements become viral, how products catch on. I found this relating to a lot of what I learned in my marketing course I took for my business minor during my sophomore year of college. It was cool to see content I learned from a class apply to real life. I look forward to reading more literature on this topic.</p>
<h3 id="16-what-happened-by-hillary-rodham-clinton">16. What Happened by Hillary Rodham Clinton</h3>
<p>I’m one for hearing all the sides of the story, and since this book recently came out in paperback, I thought I’d give it a shot. I really liked reading Hillary’s stories of being on the campaign trail and the people who influenced the race. It makes me want to read more about other presidents and their campaigns and the crazy things that happened during them.</p>
<h3 id="17-prisoners-of-geography-ten-maps-that-tell-you-everything-you-need-to-know-about-global-politics-by-tim-marshall">17. Prisoners of Geography: Ten Maps That Tell You Everything You Need To Know About Global Politics by Tim Marshall</h3>
<p>I bought this book at the Barnes and Noble on Georgia Tech’s campus when I was there with a couple of friends to participate in a hackathon. I read a lot of it on the plane on the way back home. I’ve always thought that maps were cool, and I’ve always been interested in politics. Marshall brought light to politics in a way that people and their emotions can’t control — the physical landscape around us.</p>
<h3 id="18-becoming-by-michelle-obama">18. Becoming by Michelle Obama</h3>
<p>THIS. BOOK. I had a lot of respect for Michelle Obama before reading this book, but after finishing this book in less than 48 hours, I was amazed. I feel like I know her as a person now, and I learned so much from her and her story. I’m looking forward to reading her memoir again and again as I grow older because I know I’ll get something different from it every time.</p>
<h3 id="19-presence-by-amy-cuddy">19. Presence by Amy Cuddy</h3>
<p>Amy Cuddy is the person who invented power-posing. I was interested in this topic and had watched her TED Talk, thinking the book would be all about power-posing. It was much more. Presence is about being in the moment and seizing each thing as it happens. This is a book I’ll be referencing any time I want to think about how to easily up your confidence and be more in the moment.</p>
<h3 id="20-thank-you-for-arguing-by-jay-heinrichs">20. Thank You For Arguing by Jay Heinrichs</h3>
<p>If you’re interesting in philosophy, debate, and argumentation, but aren’t interested in combing through pages and pages of dryness and difficult vocabulary, this book is for you. This book will teach you how to win arguments, all about all the fallacies, and does it all while being really funny.</p>
<h3 id="21-grit-by-angela-duckworth">21. Grit by Angela Duckworth</h3>
<p>Grit is something that’s been talked about ever since I was in high school, when as a Mustang mentor we showed Angela Duckworth’s TED Talk to the freshmen. I never thought twice about it — of course, perseverance is the solution to everything, right? Grit is all about perseverance and achieving things against the odds. Reading it in 2018, I didn’t agree with everything I read in this book. I don’t think perseverance is the entire story. reading the psychology and the studies is always interesting to me.</p>
<h3 id="22-moonwalking-with-einstein-by-joshua-foer">22. Moonwalking with Einstein by Joshua Foer</h3>
<p>This is another book I picked up during my time in Washington. This one’s all about one journalist’s journey to improving his memory and competing in the USA Memory Championships. This book was interesting in and of itself, but what I found really notable about it was the fact that I’d seen a lot of the anecdotes before from reading books on similar subject matter. It was cool to see the different ideas being reinforced!</p>
<h3 id="23-homo-deus-by-yuval-noah-harari">23. Homo Deus by Yuval Noah Harari</h3>
<p>The last book I read in 2018. This book has made me think more than almost any other book in this list. Homo Deus is a “brief history of tomorrow” and it talks about how instead of worshipping gods, we’re starting to worship humanity. It talks about the difference between science and religion, whether or not they’re actually that different at all. Harari has outdone himself again, and it was the perfect way to end the year out in books!</p>
<p>And that’s it! I’m really thankful to have made time to read in 2018. It has 100% been the best decision for my mental health and my constant desire to be learning something new. I hope you are able to find something in this list that you enjoy, and if you do, I’d love to chat about it with you. If you have any book recommendations for 2019, hit me up in the comments!</p>
<p>Wishing a happy, healthy, and safe New Year to all of you. Here’s to 2019!</p>
